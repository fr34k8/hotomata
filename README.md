# Hotomata

_Lighth weight configuration managment tool written in Go (yaml+ssh)_

Hotomata is hopefully easy to use and usable for serious projects but in all
cases a great learning experience and fun project.

For simpler use cases it is more aproachable than bigger players in the field.

**Hotomata** draws inspiration from _Ansible_ and _SaltStack_ but also from few
open source, not widely popular projects like [dynport/urknall](http://github.com/dynport/urknall)
or [sudharsh/henchman](http://github.com/sudharsh/henchman) and even few SaaSes
out there like [commando.io](https://commando.io) or [devo.ps](https://devo.ps)
