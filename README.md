# Hotomata

_Light weight configuration management tool written in Go (yaml+ssh)_

Hotomata is hopefully easy to use and candidate for serious projects but in all
cases a great learning experience and fun project.

For simpler use cases it is more aproachable than bigger players in the field.

**Hotomata** draws inspiration from _Ansible_ and _SaltStack_ but also from few
open source, not widely popular projects like [dynport/urknall](http://github.com/dynport/urknall)
or [sudharsh/henchman](http://github.com/sudharsh/henchman) and even few SaaSes
out there like [commando.io](https://commando.io) or [devo.ps](https://devo.ps)

## Getting started

```bash
go get github.com/merd/hotomata/cmd/hotomata
hotomata -h
```

## Documentation

There is plenty of documentation being written, even before code sometimes so go
an dscour those to understand better what `hotomata` has to offer:

- [Overview](https://github.com/merd/hotomata/blob/master/docs/overview.md)
- [Masterplan file](https://github.com/merd/hotomata/blob/master/docs/masterplan_file.md)
- [Inventory file](https://github.com/merd/hotomata/blob/master/docs/inventory_file.md)

## Contributions

... are welcomed, hoping the docs are giving you a good idea of what's going on,
if not I hope the code is clear enough to understand what's happening, in any case
drop me a line if you want to help or know more (frederic@gingras.cc)
